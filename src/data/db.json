This will generate the boiler plate for the file. Give the website a title. Go in the body section and add a h1 and put \"My first website\" in between the opening and closing h1 element tag. Go to the extension's tab in vs code and search for live server. Once the extension is installed, go back the the index.html file. At the bottom is  a \"Go Live\" button. Click on it and you should see the heading of \"My First Website\". Congratulations!! You've created you first HTML file.",
